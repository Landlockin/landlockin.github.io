    <p><span>The time traveler’s birthplace was ashes, his oldest memory lit by flames. Flickering lights that swallowed through their homes and left behind a wasteland of smoke, charcoal and seas of searing lava. </span></p>

<p><span>He couldn’t remember who helped put out the fires. Whoever it was, he owed them. But his relief of seeing clear skies and happy faces was short-lived.  </span></p>

<p><span>The next time, inferno covered the planet and brought it back down into fiery ruins.</span></p>

<p><span>Then, the planet was destroyed with no records of why, save for a single statue of a certain mad scientist. </span></p>

<p><span>And then the planet was coated with metal, empty of life, a shell of what it used to be. </span></p>

<p><span>His time was in a flux. Ever-changing, each time a response to a mess in the past. Time and time again he had to travel back, clean the mess to fix his future, and he had turned back the clock a thousand times back again, and again. And again.</span></p>

<p><span>At least now was one of those periods of peace. He would occasionally look up at the sky to remind himself that he could see it. He would smile every time. This time, it was clear, blue, and shining in the reflections of the skyscrapers, and the large windows on city buildings. </span></p>

<p><span>Civilians, Chao, robots and half-robots covered the city streets he walked through. Shiny, steel vehicles hovered through the roads, with lights that would go neon at night and were bright white at day. He passed by a few blocks, bushes, and a poster with a badger advertising </span><em><span>“Need extra oxygen before heading down south? Buy our masks, and take this city’s fresh air with you anywhere!”</span></em><span> to find the train station, where a flock of others would wait with him.</span></p>

<p><span>A few of them chatted amongst each other. One of them scoffed and pointed at something; on a deep blue hologram in the air, it buzzed ‘DELAYED’ over the near-top of the time table.</span><em><span> ‘Even the most peaceful futures aren’t freed from everyday inconveniences.’ </span></em><span>He sat down on a sleek, white bench, and he waited.</span></p>

<p><span>Then, a familiar feeling rose in the air.</span></p>

<p><span>“Huh?” His quills rose. The world around him shook in an odd way. Static surrounded him and muffled every noise. He stood up from the bench. A cyan aura emitted around him as he hovered upwards, around a tree and over the rooftops. </span></p>

<p><em><span>‘I guess that train’s never coming.’</span></em></p>
